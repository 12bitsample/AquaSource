                      <p class="bg-transparent text-white">"Chris is fantastic!  He has hauled water for our pool for 3 years now and I wouldnâ€™t think of using anyone else.  Even during his busiest time, I always get a text or return call. Very personable and I enjoy talking about our families and pets while the water flows.  :)  He is honest and up front when setting expectations.  Great service!"</p>
