Even during his busiest time, I always get a text or return call. Very personable and I enjoy talking about our families and pets while the water flows.  :)  He is honest and up front when setting expectations.  Great service!'

      name: 'Laura Young', review: 'Prompt at answering through calls and texts. Initially, said it may be a week but he was there to fill our pool in two days. Chris was super friendly and helpful. He even made sure our liner was correct as it filled! Highly recommend!'
